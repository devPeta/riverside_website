<p className="font-poppins text-gray font-bold text-1xl mt-8">
  The way we travel and move has changed in the last few years. We no longer want the typical photo that all our contacts post on Instagram.
  <br />
  We no longer want to elbow our way through crowded museums. We no longer want to view the city through the mobile lens.
</p>

<p className="font-poppins text-gray font-bold text-1xl mt-8">
  It’s not about travelling, it’s about discovering. Travellers are the 21st century pilgrims who seek the basic, long-lasting and human essence.
  <br />
  The city is a canvas of emotions and experiences and culture is the invisible architecture that frames it.
</p>

<p className="font-poppins text-gray font-bold text-1xl mt-8">
  Only YOU designs a new way of travelling inspired by the local and human connection where each hotel turns into a reflection of its
  <br />
  environment. Dear travellers: you’ve reached your destination.
